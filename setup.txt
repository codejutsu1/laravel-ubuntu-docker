- To create a new Laravel project on a system with no composer, php or other dependencies installed
- Download Docker 
- Start Docker
- For Ubuntu, open your terminal
- check if docker is installed, "docker --version"
- Navigate to the path you want your project to be eg $cd Downloads/Projects
- Run "docker run --rm -v $HOME/.cache/composer:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app -w /app composer composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel {your-app-name}"
    - This creates the latest composer image if not available
    - And installs a new laravel project into your system.

    -If installed, check for the files permission, "ls -lf {your-app-name}"
    -if root, 
        run "$sudo chown -R ${USER}: {your-app-name}
    or create a new project by running this command
        "docker run -u ${UID}:${UID} --rm -v $HOME/.cache/composer:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app -w /app composer composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel {your-app-name}"
