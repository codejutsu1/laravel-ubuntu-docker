- To create a new Laravel project on a system with no composer, php or other dependencies installed
- Download Docker 
- Start Docker
- For Ubuntu, open your terminal
- check if docker is installed, "docker --version"
- Navigate to the path you want your project to be eg $cd Downloads/Projects
- Run "docker run --rm -v $HOME/.cache/composer:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app -w /app composer composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel {your-app-name}"
    - This creates the latest composer image if not available
    - And installs a new laravel project into your system.

    -If installed, check for the files permission, "ls -lf {your-app-name}"
    -if root, 
        run "$sudo chown -R ${USER}: {your-app-name}
    or create a new project by running this command
        "docker run -u ${UID}:${UID} --rm -v $HOME/.cache/composer:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app -w /app composer composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel {your-app-name}"


To run sail (Second Option)

- Visit "https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects"

for the errors bootstrap/cache must be present and writable
    - sudo chmod -R 777 storage/
    - sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap/

Then

./vendor/bin/sail up -d 

To run project on composer and php

docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app laravelsail/php83-composer bash

then access the terminal

............

1. docker run: This tells Docker to run a container.

2. --rm: This option tells Docker to remove the container after it exits. It's optional, but it's useful for cleanup.

3 . -it: These options combine two flags: -i keeps STDIN open even if not attached, and -t allocates a pseudo-TTY. This makes the container interactive, so you can type commands into it.

4. -v $(pwd):/app:  we're connecting the folder you're currently working in (that's what $(pwd) means, it's just the folder you're in) to a place inside the container called "/app". So, anything you have in your current folder, the container can see it too!

5. laravelsail/php83-composer bash: The bash from this image from sail.
